># Challenge #12 - **Javascript Conditions**

---

In this Challenge, i used Vanilla Javascript, Sass and Bootstrap, to give different functionalities to three index.html.
The first of them, border_on.js , gives a border to an image when you click it and remove it when you click it again.
The second, sticker.js, makes a validation about the quantity of stickers needed by the user with a max of 10 units of them.
The third, password.js makes a validation for two correct passwords, Pass #1 is 911 and Pass #2 is 714. Any other combination will be denied.
>>The  installation method for Sass and Bootstrap was mediantly NPM.
